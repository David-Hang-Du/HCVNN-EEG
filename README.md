# HCVNN EEG

This repository contains the codes to reproduce the result in our paper "A Hybrid Complex-valued Neural Network Framework
with Applications to Electroencephalogram (EEG)".

Our python code is refer to this repository "https://github.com/dreamgonfly/cnn-from-scratch".

You also need to download "fuzzyen.m" and 'sampen.m'.
